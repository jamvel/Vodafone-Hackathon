	- Templates can be preset
	- Children then play the lessons their parents set up
## Pairing voluntary help with those who need it

During Xmas social workers post what they kids needs
Basically the social worker is responsible for a kid. 
	And the kid for xmas wants clothes, nintendo money for school

LinkedIn for Aid - we gonna create a newsfeed for helping too
 
Employers can get employees involved ukoll, as part a csr they can donate employee time (Corporate Social Responsibility)

U qaltli li its a logistical nightmare biex ilahqu mal giving back to community clause of gaming
What they didnt like is getting things from what you do
In game is fine
Actually receiving no
They suggested pairing groups of users to do stuff
The pillars are money / time / objects mainly
U exchange
Li qisu ogbitom li by time i get paid by a sponsor
In an ingame balance
To reinvest
Li ghogbitom hafna the what happened aspect u vetting ta fejn sejrin money u people story after
They agreed on selling the concept not a poc as such
Csr imp hafna apparently
U if we do a scoreboard with awards at the end of the yr companies would do well
U the points are achieve by their employees
Csr boosts
ma employee accounts contribute to the company
We must make a private tick box
From both sides
U dejjem kull cause must be represented by an entity
With a rep score
(Similar to ebay jekk tafu kif tahdem)
U profile based
So jekk andi problem
I go on ngo through app
And send msg similar to fb
We can pair needs ukol
Dog sitting with socially awkward kids ez

Company habba csr u awards
No saviour complex and no dehumisation
